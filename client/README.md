This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Another React Chat

This is a simple React app that aims to be simple so it doesn't use any CSS-in-JS library.
Also as this is just for having fun and I didn't think it to scale or add new features I didn't write any test. I know I should write them, maybe in the future.
